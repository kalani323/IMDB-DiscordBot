## IMDB-DiscordBot
# Kansas State University CIS200 Project (FALL 2021)
A few classmates and I created a discord bot in java that utilizes multiple APIs.
José, the movie bot, utilizes the discord API and the IMDB API to find the link to a show/movie trailer when a command is typed in on discord. For example, if your movie was the Avengers, you would type “!the avengers” into a discord chat containing the bot, it will respond with the link of the trailer. If the show or movie does not exist, it will give you an error.
We learned:
- We learned how to use and write code that utilizes an API 
- We also learned what JSON data is, how to “extract it” and turn it into strings. 
- We learned the basics of creating a discord bot through eclipse (java) and also registering the bot with discord
- We learned how to use referenced libraries (paths) in eclipse
